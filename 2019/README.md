# AOC2019

In my 2019 solutions I'll try to look for Rust things I haven't used before, or
just simple code if the day is challenging.

Day1: I had never used the stabilized `std::convert::TryFrom` before

Day2: Nothing special, tried out `go`... Got my source code file overwritten by the compiler.

Day3: Iterator training, deep error propagation, generic `Point<T>`... Suprised I passed in the end.

Day4: Failed to try out anything, there were no complications. Possible optimizations yes but I am not interested in those.

Day5: Crate extraction practice. Using types and whatnot paying off with `intcode`, succeeded at first submissions. Possibly need to extract another crate as currently the "read 'input' file and test with it" code is copypasted for `day02` and `day05`.
